# lionessRepo

This has example code for the original param sweep to use the original Lioness code from the paper by Kimberly Glass, John Quackenbush et. al.  
The Lioness code was nicely provided from Marieke Kuijjer's repository.  The use of Panda (not Pandas) here is basically nonfunctioning and only to feed into Lioness.
